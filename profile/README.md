## 🚀 What is SideOrg?

A collective of indie hackers, builders, and explorers working on side projects that matter.  
No VC. No pressure. Just passion, pixels, and pushing code for fun (and sometimes profit).

Whether it’s weekend hacks, product experiments, or open-source tools —  
**if it’s worth building, we build it together.**

## 📜 Manifesto

```text
We believe side projects aren’t side quests —
They’re experiments in freedom, creativity, and self-expression.

We’re not building startups.  
We’re building momentum, skill, and joy.

No gatekeepers. No deadlines.  
Just the will to ship.
